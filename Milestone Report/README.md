# Milestone Report README


## Overview

This repo contains my work for the [capstone project][1] of the
[Data Science Specialization][2] from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. This
folder contains my work for one of the key deliverables: the milestone report.

## Detailed Description

The overall [project][3] focuses on natural language processing, with a goal of
building an application which can predict the next word based on a sequence of
words input from a user. The project progresses through several key phases such
as data exploration and cleaning, then model building and optimization, before
wrapping up with application development and an associated "sales pitch"
presentation for the app. Three key deliverables throughout the project are:
a milestone report describing the exploratory data analysis, the application
itself, and a presentation.

The purpose of the milestone report is to demonstrate how the data were
processed and explored. The report, which can be viewed [here][4] highlights
features of the data which are critical for the next phases of the project. This
repo folder contains a .R script which was used to meet the basic requirments
underlying the deliverable. The script was then used as the basis for an R
markdown file which was then used to build the actual html report. The exact
text from the instructors for the milestone report criteria is shown below:

>#### Milestone Report Review Criteria:
>
>* Does the link lead to an HTML page describing the exploratory analysis of
the training data set?
>* Has the data scientist done basic summaries of the three files? Word counts,
line counts and basic data tables?
>* Has the data scientist made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate
features of the data?
>* Was the report written in a brief, concise style, in a way that a non-data
scientist manager could appreciate?
