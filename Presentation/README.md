# Text Predictor App Presentation README


## Overview

This repo contains my work for the [capstone project][1] of the
[Data Science Specialization][2] from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. This
folder contains my work for one of the key deliverables: the presentation.

## Detailed Description

The overall [project][3] focuses on natural language processing, with a goal of
building an application which can predict the next word based on a sequence of
words input from a user. The project progresses through several key phases such
as data exploration and cleaning, then model building and optimization, before
wrapping up with application development and an associated "sales pitch"
presentation for the app. Three key deliverables throughout the project are:
a milestone report describing the exploratory data analysis, the application
itself, and a presentation.

The app is hosted on shinyapps.io and can be accessed [here][4]. The files in
this repo are a .RPres and a .md file to produce the actual presentation which
is the .html file which can be viewed on RPubs [here][5]. The review criteria
for this deliverable are shown below.

>#### Slide Deck Review Criteria:
>
>* Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?
>* Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the
prediction?
>* Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it
functions?
