# Text-Prediction-Model-and-App Project README


## Overview

This repo contains my work for the [capstone project][1] of the
[Data Science Specialization][2] from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The
project has a wide scope and multiple deliverables. RStudio was used for all
parts of the project.

## Detailed Description

The project focuses on natural language processing, and the ultimate goal is to 
build an application which can predict the next word based on a sequence of
words input from a user. The project progresses through several key phases such
as data exploration and cleaning, then model building and optimization, before
wrapping up with application development and an associated "sales pitch"
presentation for the app. Three key deliverables throughout the project are:
a milestone report describing the exploratory data analysis, the application
itself, and a presentation.

The data for the project were provided by the course. Due to the large file size 
(548 Mb when compressed) the data are not in the repo, but can be downloaded by
clicking [this link][3]. Provided in four languages, the data were originally
collected from publicly available sources using a web crawler. The sources
included blogs, news articles, and Twitter. This project only uses the English
data.

The top node of this repo contains the primary script which is a work in
progress but will be used to meet the core requirements of the project. There is
also a folder containing any pieces related to the milestone report. In the
milestone folder there is a .R script which was used to meet the basic
requirments underlying the deliverable. The script was then used as the basis
for an R markdown file which was then used to build the actual html report. The
exact text from the instructors for the milestone report criteria is shown
below:

>#### Milestone Report Review Criteria:
>
>* Does the link lead to an HTML page describing the exploratory analysis of
the training data set?
>* Has the data scientist done basic summaries of the three files? Word counts,
line counts and basic data tables?
>* Has the data scientist made basic plots, such as histograms to illustrate
features of the data?
>* Was the report written in a brief, concise style, in a way that a non-data
scientist manager could appreciate?
